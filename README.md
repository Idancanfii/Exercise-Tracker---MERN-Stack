# Exercise-Tracker---MERN-Stack
This is an app I made for tracking exercises by posting them into a user database (MongoDB) The frontend is made with React

Feel free to dowload the code and reuse it (I did it with a course of freecodecamp).

For the database I used MongoDB Atlas
Built a costum API 
React frontend

The models, routes and server.js are the backend folders/files
The src and pudlic are the react frontend (with create-react-app).
The .env file is the key for the MongoBD Atlas
Dont forget to npm install after opening the folder in VScode.

Let me know what you think,
Cheers, Idan
